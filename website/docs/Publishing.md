# Publishing your website


If you are using git and github pages, you can publish your doc website with one command:

`moonwave build --publish`

Otherwise, you can run `moonwave build`, and your built website will be in a folder called `build` in your project directory.

:::caution
Remember to add the `build` folder to your `.gitignore`!
