# Moonwave

Moonwave is a command line tool for generating documentation from comments in Lua source code.

This repository contains three projects:
- The Moonwave Extractor, a Rust program that parses Lua files and extracts the docs as JSON
- A plugin for [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), written in React, which displays the JSON docs visually
- The Moonwave CLI, which allows you to use both the extractor and the Docusaurus plugin without needing to know anything about how they work.

## Key features

- Easy to use: You can generate a website with little-to-no configuration and just a few comments in your Lua code.
- Extensive validation system which can catch mistakes when something doesn't make sense.
- Generates JSON from your doc comments, which can be consumed by many different tools.
- Simple doc comment format that is easy to read directly when editing your code.

## Demo

Check out the [roblox-lua-promise](https://eryn.io/roblox-lua-promise/api/Promise) docs. This website is completely generated by Moonwave!

## Name

Lua is the moon. The moon is your code. The moon influences the waves in the ocean, just like your code influences its documentation. So.. moonwave!
