# Moonwave

Moonwave is a command line tool for generating documentation from comments in Lua source code. Moonwave generates a JSON representation of your documentation, which can be used by other tools to do things like create websites or provide IntelliSense information.

[Moonpress] is a command line tool that uses Moonwave internally to generate a documentation website for your code. If this is all you're after, then you should only need to use Moonpress directly, and it will invoke Moonwave on your code automatically.

## Key features
- Extensive validation system which can catch mistakes when something doesn't make sense.
- Generates JSON from your doc comments, which can be consumed by many different tools.
- Simple doc comment format that is easy to read directly when editing your code.
- It's *really* fast.

## Name
Lua is the moon. The moon is your code. The moon influences the waves in the ocean, just like your code influences its documentation. So.. moonwave!
